Predictive Modeling for Restaurant Revenue Prediction Using Machine Learning

[Dataset]("C:\\Users\\spsuc\\Downloads\\restaurant_data.csv")

# Introduction

### This project aims to develop an advanced machine learning model to predict restaurant revenue based on a diverse set of attributes. The dataset encompasses various features related to the restaurant's characteristics, operations, and marketing efforts. The following steps outline the primary processes involved in this project:

# Project Steps

## 1. Data Collection:

+ ####  Gathered a dataset with features such as location, cuisine, rating, seating capacity, average meal price, marketing budget, social media followers, chef experience years, number of reviews, average review length, ambience score, service quality score, parking availability, weekend reservations, weekday reservations, and revenue.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

+ #### Removed outliers and handled missing values to ensure data quality.
+ #### Deleted columns with multicollinearity to avoid redundancy and improve model performance.

## 3..Feature Engineering:

+ #### Created new features and transformed existing ones to better represent the data.

# 4. Model Selection:

+ #### Explored several regression algorithms including LinearRegression,DecisionTreeRegressor,ExtraTreeRegressor,RandomForestRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor

# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

+ #### Used GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning and find the best parameters for each model

# 6. Model Evaluation:

+ #### Evaluated the models using metrics such as RMSE ,MSE ,MAE, R2_Score

+ #### Selected the Random Forest Regressor as the best-performing model based on these metrics.

# 7. Model Saving and Loading:

+ #### Saved the trained Random Forest  Regression model using joblib.

+ #### Provided code for loading the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

# 8.Future Work:

+  #### Suggested improvements include collecting more data on restaurant operations, exploring different machine learning algorithms, addressing potential class imbalances, and adding more features such as customer demographics and seasonal trends to enhance the model's accuracy and performance.

## By following these steps, the project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to developing and deploying a machine learning model for predicting restaurant revenue. This offers valuable insights for restaurant owners and managers to optimize their operations and improve profitability.
